## 📝 Description

Server-Sent Event (SSE) streaming communication requires an implementation of EventSource and currently, no other EventSource polyfill exists for Titanium Native mobile apps.  This package was written to be fully spec compliant:  https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html  More features may be added to this client but goal is to keep it compliant.

Titanium EventSource is based on [EventSource Polyfill](https://github.com/mattkrick/event-source-polyfill) by [Matt Krick](https://github.com/mattkrick).


## 🚀 Getting Started

> This module is meant to be used with Titanium Native mobile apps
 
There are several ways this module can be used by Titanium.  It is likely that the package or library you are using for SSE already has this package as a dependency, in which case, you do not need to do anything further.

> Please ensure there is a package.json file in the target directory.  If there is not one present, you can create one with `npm init`.


If you are building an SSE module yourself and wish to use Titanium EventSource or you wish to install this in an app using Titanium Turbo, you can execute this in the project root directory:

```
npm install @titanium/eventsource
```

If you wish to install this in a Titanium Alloy app, you an install this by executing the following in the project root directory:

```

cd app
npm install @titanium/eventsource

```
